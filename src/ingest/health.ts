/**
 * What the feed records about a source, from the document it just parsed.
 *
 * This is one function rather than a few lines inside `scripts/build-feed.ts`
 * because of how the rule it carries went wrong. The refresh runner and the
 * feed builder both have to tell three zeros apart — a parser that can no
 * longer read a redesigned page, a page whose events have all ended, and a page
 * that says it currently lists none — and the runner learned the third on
 * 2026-09-03 while the builder did not. Nothing caught that: the builder is a
 * top-level script that fetches nothing but writes `public/`, so importing it
 * from a test runs a build, and the rule sat where no test could reach it.
 *
 * That is the same argument the `ci.yml` comment already makes about
 * `brokenSources`: behaviour belongs where behaviour can be exercised.
 * `docs/INGESTION.md` § Stage 1 carries the rule itself.
