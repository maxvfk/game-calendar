/**
 * Fandom wikis, read through the MediaWiki action API.
 *
 * **Why the API and not the page.** `reverse1999.fandom.com/wiki/Events`
 * answers a non-browser client with a Cloudflare interstitial ("Just a
 * moment…", HTTP 403), and dressing our fetcher up as a browser to get past it
 * would be defeating a deliberate access control — the reason `uma.moe` was
 * declined in AGENTS.md § Scraping conduct. The wiki's own `robots.txt` instead
 * *allows* `/api.php?action=` for `User-agent: *`, and that endpoint answers our
 * real User-Agent with a 200. So this parser reads the sanctioned surface with
 * no impersonation anywhere: same headers, a path the site put in writing.
 *
 * The body is therefore JSON rather than HTML:
 *
 *   {"parse":{"title":"Events","pageid":3479,"text":"<div …>"}}
 *
 * `parse.text` is the rendered wikitext, and the shape below is what this family
 * of pages puts in it — `wikitable`s under one `h2` per section:
 *
 *   <h2>Version Events</h2>
 *   <table class="wikitable sortable">
 *     <tr><th>Event</th><th>Time Period</th><th>Version</th></tr>
 *     <tr><td><span …><img …></span><br><b>TITLE</b></td>
 *         <td>August 13th, 05:00 - September 21st, 2026, 04:59 (UTC-5)</td>
 *         <td>3.7</td>
 *
 * Two details decide most of the code.
 *
 * **The title is the `<b>`, never the cell text.** The cell leads with a banner
 * image, and when that image is missing MediaWiki renders a red link whose
 * visible text is `File:A Stranger to Memory Lane Banner.png`. A cell-text
 * reader publishes that as the event's name. The `<b>` holds the title in both
 * cases.
 *
 * **These pages are archives, not schedules.** All five tables list every event
 * since 1.1 — 154 rows, of which six had not yet ended when the fixture was
 * captured. Publishing the rest would put three years of finished events on the
 * calendar and hand the validator a hundred rows whose start predates its
 * two-year sanity window. So inclusion is decided against `ctx.now`, which is
 * injected precisely so a parser can be time-aware without reading the clock.

 * The English-server half of the Fate/Grand Order wiki.
 *
 * **The page is chosen, not incidental.** This wiki publishes two schedules:
 * `Event_List` opens "This page lists all Events in Fate/Grand Order Japan",
 * and `Event_List_(US)` is the English server. They run months apart and the
 * Japanese one is the trap — the same hazard as the CN column on `akwiki` and
 * the JP tab on `bawiki`, and the same answer: publish the server our readers
 * are on. Each page links the other, so landing on the wrong one is easy and
 * silent.
 *
 * **Only the ongoing section is parsed**, of the three the page fences off:
 *
 * - `ONGOING EVENTS` — one `<h2>` per event with a `<b>Duration:</b>` line
 *   stating both boundaries. This is the section with dates in it.
 * - `FUTURE EVENTS` — an `Upcoming Events | ETA` table whose ETA column reads
 *   `August 2026`. A month with no day is not a start date, and a start date is
 *   half of an event id, so these are skipped rather than pinned to the 1st.
 * - `PAST EVENTS` — 111 monthly tables of finished events. Unlike the Japanese
 *   page, whose equivalent tables carry the month in a `MMYYYY` table id, these
 *   state no year anywhere in the markup. Undatable, and history regardless.
 *
 * **The dates state a zone but no clock.** Every duration ends `PDT`, which is
 * what makes the single Pacific-time server visible, but the boundaries are
 * bare calendar days. So they are read as day precision on the day the page
 * states and *not* shifted into UTC: with no time of day to anchor, converting
 * would move the stated day for a fact the page never published. `PDT` is also
 * a daylight abbreviation the page swaps for `PST` in winter, which is exactly
 * the shifting-offset case `NAMED_ZONE_OFFSET_MS` refuses to carry.
 *
 * **The section is sliced by index, then split on `<h2>`.** A single regex
 * spanning heading-to-duration needs nested lazy quantifiers, and on a 620KB
 * body those backtrack catastrophically the moment one of the anchors stops
 * matching — a renamed `Duration:` label would hang the refresh runner instead
 * of yielding nothing. Bounded character classes cannot do that.
