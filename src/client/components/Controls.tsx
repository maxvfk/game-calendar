 * because the panel was tall, and with the groups closed the whole thing is
 * shorter than the header above it. That is a claim about the *groups*, not
 * about the panel's width — the rows run the full column, and the one list long
 * enough to need it takes two columns of its own inside its group.

 * Which games the reader plays, and the order they read them in.
 *
 * One row per game rather than the chip row this replaced: a reorder affordance
 * needs somewhere to put a handle and two arrows, and at fourteen games a list
 * reads better than a wrapped row of pills anyway.
 *
 * **Reordering lives here and nowhere else.** The focus bar and the dailies strip
 * are the fastest tap targets on the page — the strip is the part of it that is
 * answerable in ten seconds — and a drag target sitting on top of a tick target
 * costs somebody a streak the first time it misfires. So the live surfaces stay
 * drag-free and this is the screen you visit on purpose.
 *
 * The row itself is not a target. The handle, the two arrows and the on/off
 * switch are four explicit controls, and nothing else here is clickable — which
 * is what keeps this the right side of "a list row is one target": that rule is
 * about a full-bleed row target with a second control hidden inside it.
