 * finish it, move to the next. Doing that with the on/off switches means two
 * taps per game and a settings panel that no longer describes what they play.
 *
 * So focus is a lens, not a setting: it never changes which games are switched
 * on, "All" is always one tap away, and the rotation ends by returning to All
 * rather than looping forever.
