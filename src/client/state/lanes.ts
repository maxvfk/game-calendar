/**
 * How the timeline is stacked: a lane per game, or every game together in
 * deadline order.
 *
 * Two different questions, and one board cannot answer both. Lanes answer "how
 * does this game's patch lay out?" — they keep a game's events adjacent and
 * comparable, which is what makes the board readable for someone playing four
 * of them. But a reader with four games also has one queue of deadlines, and
 * lanes scatter it: the thing ending tonight sits three lanes below the thing
 * ending next month, and no amount of scrolling puts them next to each other.
 *
 * Pure, and its own module rather than logic inside `Timeline`, because `prefs`
 * stores the chosen mode and the two must agree on what is valid — the same
 * reason `zoom.ts` exists.

 * Stack the board's rows the way the reader asked for.
 *
 * The merged mode sorts with `endingSoonestFirst`, the same comparator the
 * list's "Ending soonest" uses, rather than a bare end-date sort — otherwise
 * the two views would mean different things by the same words, and an event
 * that has not started yet would cut in above one that is running out tonight.
 * It also carries the `endsAt: null` rule for free: an unannounced end sorts
 * behind every dated one instead of pretending to a position in the queue.
 *
 * Lane mode leaves the order it was given alone. The rows arrive sorted by
 * whatever the reader chose in the list, and grouping them by game is not a
 * licence to re-sort inside a game.
 *
 * `split` is the exception to that last sentence, and deliberately so. Both
 * orders above hold every unstarted event behind every running one, which is
 * the segregation the board's "Not started yet" heading names — so a reader who
 * asks for them mixed in is asking for exactly that clause to be dropped, and
 * `byDeadline` is the same comparator with it gone. It applies in **both**
 * modes, lane mode included: leaving a lane's given order alone there would
 * produce the block it was told not to draw, minus the heading that explained
 * it, which is the worst of both answers.
 *
 * `gameOrder` stacks the lanes themselves — the reader's own game order, so
 * their main game is the top lane instead of whichever one held the first row.
 * It orders **lanes and never the rows inside one**, which is the same rule as
 * above read one level up. A game the order does not name sorts after the ones
 * it does, in the order its rows arrived, so this stays total for a lane the
 * reader never placed. Omitted leaves the stacking exactly as it was.
 *
 * The merged mode ignores it, having one lane and no game to order by.
