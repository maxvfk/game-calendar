# Two stages so the image ships the built assets and nothing else: no source,
# no fixtures, no toolchain. The build is fully offline — it parses the
# committed snapshots, falling back to checked-in fixtures, rather than
# fetching anything — so the image is reproducible and needs no network at
# build time.

# a README), so this cannot break a build made before the first refresh — it

# served fresh, with nothing to say why.
